Sample Android code for AT&T Speech API.

Please read the documentation for setting up the sample app to run.

1. Need access to ATT developer site and download the sdk zip files from there.
2. Register an application in the developer site and the access and secret key will be generated and that needs to be added to the Sample apps.

Beta Library Version Contains the following Changes:

1. JSON Exception Error(Auth API Spike violation issue handled properly).
2. Key Decryption Issue Fix(Now the library can run on 4.2 and above device also).
3. ADS setReloadPeriod is defaulted to Minimum of 30 seconds(if the application tries to set the reload period less than 30 seconds SDK will override that to 30 seconds).
4. ADS cropped issue(In the application while setting the SetlayoutParams(), use the pixels instead of dp value, i.e px = dp*(dpi/160) or specify the height to webview in dp+(dp/2)).
